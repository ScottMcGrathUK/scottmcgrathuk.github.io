# Why I'm setting this up

I use WordPress to write content but find it a bit bloated. It's become more of a fully fledged CMS these days so probably not great for just jotting down ideas or code snippets I want to keep.

So let's see how Jekyll goes.

I'm going to be dumping some retrospective articles on here from other sources like OneNote and will date them the date of the source just to create a timeline.

So although I'm posting this on teh 13 July 2024, I may change the date of it as I go just to keep it the first post.

## My setup

This is how I set it up.

I'm using Jekyll deployed on my MacBook Air to get setup. Then hosting to Github Pages because it's free.

Jekyll uses Markdown to inject content and render pages according to the theme you use.

I'm using Chirpy because it's easy to deploy and has what I want.

I can write Markdown articles, it has search, catagories, tags. I can embed images.

This theme is well cool it can be found at [Chirpy Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter?tab=readme-ov-file) and the author as even written a GitHub action to deploy the new pages at a Push.
